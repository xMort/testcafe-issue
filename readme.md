# TestCafe issue

There is an issue when I try to click on [HighChart](https://www.highcharts.com/)'s line chart with [TestCafe](https://testcafe.devexpress.com/).
I can click on the line chart marker to fire an event only in the hacky way.

## Setup and run project

Have a Google Chrome installed and run following commands to setup the project and run the tests that illustrate the issue.

`npm install`

`npm test`
